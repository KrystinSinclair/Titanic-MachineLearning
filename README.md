# Titanic-MachineLearning
Group 6 Project

Final Project for Machine Learning I 

DATS 6202 - Fall 2018

Instructor: Yuxiao Huang

Students: Krystin Sinclair, Lydia Jin and Xi Qian

This project is from a Kaggle Compeititon.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

This competition provides 2 csv files. 
The first is for training and the second is for testing. 
The test csv does not include the target varaible in order to find final accuracy of the model the prediction of the target is uploaded to kaggle and is then compared to the actual target. 

This project was completed using python in a jupyter notebook file. 

The jupyter notebook file does require pandas, numpy, SciPy, MatPlotlib, Seaborn, and sklearn packages.

The objective of this project is to identify who would survive the Titanic shipwreck of 1912. 
The target variable is "Survived" a binary variable where No=0 and Yes =1. 
The data provided by the competition includes 9 feature variables, which are: ticket class and number, sex, age, number of siblings and/or spouses, number of parents and/or children, the cost of the ticket, the cabin number and where the passenger embarked on the boat.

The jupyter notebooked file is completed in the order of data cleaning, EDA, and lastly model selection.
